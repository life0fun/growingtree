; query API results as a list of fact tuples. Fact tuple is a list of entity Ids.
;   [ [tuple1...] [tuple2...] ]
;
; the intermediate value for joining are :db/id, can be in both [entity attr val] pos
; to join, the attribute col in tuple is the join col, and val.
;
; find ?e ret entity id, (d/touch(d/entity db) to convert to lazy entity.
;   (d/touch (d/entity db (ffirst (d/q '[:find ?e :where [?e :parent/fname]] db)))
;
;
; query stmt is a list, or a map, with :find :in :where seps query args.
;   [?a â€¦]  collection   [ [?a ?b ] ]  relation
;   [(predicate ...)] [(function ...) bindings]
;
; a named rule is a list of clause [(community-type ?c ?t) [?c :community/type ?t]])]
; a set of rules is a list of rules. [[[rule1 ?c] [_ :x ?c]] [[rule2 ?d] [_ :x ?d]]]
; rules with the same name defined multiple times in rule set make rule OR.
;   [[northern ?c] (region ?c :region/ne)]
;   [[northern ?c] (region ?c :region/n)]
; Within the same rule, multiple tuples are AND.
;
;
; all eids must be number, use read-string to convert from command line.
; all the :ref :many attribute stores clojure.lang.MapEntry. use :db/id to get the id.
; knowing entity id, query with (d/entity db eid). otherwise, [:find $t :where []]
; (d/entity db eid) rets the entity. entity is LAZY. attr only availabe when touch.
; To add data to a new entity, build a transaction using :db/add implicitly
; with the map structure (or explicitly with the list structure), a temporary id,
; and the attributes and values being added.
;
; #db/id[partition-name value*] : value is an optional negative number.
; all instances of the same temp id are mapped to the same actual entity id in a given transaction,
; {:db/id entity-id attribute value attribute value ... }
; [:db/add entity-id attribute value]
; (d/transact conn [newch [:db/add pid :parent/child (:db/id newch)]]
; d/transact tx-data is a list of lists, each of which specifies a write operation
; for single write datom(map tuple), wrap with [datom-tuple]
; for a list of write datom tuple from map, use (vec ([] [])) to wrap them.
; (d/transact conn (vec (map make-attr (d/q '[:find ?e :where []))))
;
;
; In general, unique temporary ids are mapped to new entity ids.
; within the same transaction, the same tempid maps to the same real entity id.
; when one of the attribute is :db/unique :db.unique/identity, system will map to existing entity if matches or make a new.
; to add fact to existing entity, retrieve entity id the add using the entity id.
; adding entity ref, must specify an entity id(could be tempid) as the attribute's value.
; takes advantage of the fact that the same temporary id can be generated multiple times by
; specifying the same partition and negative number; and that all instances of a given temporary id
; within a transaction will resolve to a single entity id.
;
; (def e (d/entity (db conn) attr-id) gets all entity with ids
; (keys e) or (:parent/child (d/entity db 17592186045703))
; entity attr rets a map entry for all children. (:parent/child (d/entity db pid))
;
; entity-id can be used at both side of the datom, e.g., give a parent entity id,
;   (d/q '[:find ?e :in $ ?attr :where [17592186045703 ?attr ?e] [...] ] db :parent/child)
;   (d/q '[:find ?e :in $ ?attr :where [?e ?attr 17592186045703] [...] ] db :child/parent)
; query :where takes a vardic list, not a list of list.
;

; outbound query and inbound query
; using parent id, get list of children
;   (:parent/child (d/entity db 17592186045476))
;
; inbound query(who refed me) is used for query another entity that refs this entity.
; parent entity can be used to query all child entity that refs to this parent entity.
; use inbound query with convention is prefix attr name with _.
;   (:child/_parent (d/entity db 17592186045476))
; = (:parent/child (d/entity db 17592186045476))
;   (-> (d/entity db 17592186045476) :child/_parent)
; this reverse look-up might be time consuming, use explicit linking might be better.
;
